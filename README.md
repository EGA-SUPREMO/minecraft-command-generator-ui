# minecraft-command-generator-ui
Command generator for Minecraft, instead of writing the command by hand, you can select some things and get generated the command automatically.

The only big problem is that only the IU is made, so you need to get your hands dirty and make the back-end part if you want to make this program useful.

This repository is abandoned as there are many other command generators that you can find by searching for "Minecraft Command Generator" and some of them are more useful than this one could be.
